        <h1>What Does The System Do ?</h1>
        <p> With the growing number of COVID-19 victims around the world, the protection against this invisible enemy is
            our priority, the most effecient way of fighting against it is to wear a face mask properly.

            is not the case anymore as observed. Most people don't wear the face mask correctly.
            This is why this face mask detection platform is built, its goal is to predict wheter someone is earing a
            face mask correctly, incorrectly or not.
            The performmance of this system relies on a model built using deep learning. A proper way of wearing a face
            mask is demonstrated below.

            <h2>Hospitals</h2>
            <p> Using Face Mask Detection System, Hospitals can monitor if their staff is wearing masks during their
                shift or not. If any health worker is found without a mask, they will receive a notification with a
                reminder to wear a mask. Also, if quarantine people who are required to wear a mask, the system can keep
                an eye and detect if the mask is present or not and send notification automatically or report to the
                authorities. </p>

            <h2>Airpots</h2>
            <p> The Face Mask Detection System can be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face data of
                travelers can be captured in the system at the entrance. If a traveler is found to be without a face
                mask, their picture is sent to the airport authorities so that they could take quick action. If the
                person’s face is already stored, like the face of an Airport worker, it can send the alert to the
                worker’s phone directly.

                The reports can be downloaded or sent an email at the end of the day to capture people who are not
                complying with the regulations or the requirements. </p>
